## Clues

- Video uploaded to Parler in Octover 2020, by Mark
- Less than a minute long and shows a "mesmerizing ufo spectacle"
- Video has a neon sign for a restaurant

We need to find a dish at the restaurant which costs $3

## Find the UFO video

Now this video is more than a minute long but it does have neon signs and a mesmerizing effect in the sky, so I decided to pursue the lead.

The neon sign says, "Robert's Western World"

Searching for "Robert's Western World Nashville" we can find their website and see their [menu](https://www.robertswesternworld.com/honky-tonk-grill)
