1. Use git branch -a to see all branches 
2. Either checkout each branch and manually the flag.py to the current dir for each feature
   Ex: git checkout feature/part-1
       cp flag.py flag1.py 
- Do this for the other 2 branches

OR 

3. Merge the branches 
   Ex: git merge feature/part-1
       git add flag.py
       git commit -m "merged feature 1"
- Do this for the other 2 branches
- NOTE: this approach will have merge conflicts in the final flag.py. Use a text-editor to fix them. 

Finally run the file
