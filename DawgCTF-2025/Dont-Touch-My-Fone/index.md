# Don't Touch My Fone

We are given a `dtmf.wav` which has audio of some numbers being dialed. The filename is a hint and it refers to [Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTMF_signaling)

I used this [online DTMF decoder](http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/index.html) (site seems to be offline at the time of writing this) to get the phone number.
